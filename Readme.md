# PracticalOpenLLMGuide

Welcome to PracticalOpenLLMGuide, a comprehensive resource designed to facilitate the use of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for various text annotation tasks. This guide complements our paper, "LLMs for Text Annotation: A Practical Guide for Model Setting and Fine-Tuning," offering hands-on scripts and detailed instructions for researchers and practitioners.

## About the Paper

Our paper evaluates the efficacy of open-source LLMs in various text classification tasks, such as relevance, topic, and stance annotation, particularly focusing on news articles and tweets. We discuss the significance of fine-tuning in optimizing LLMs' performance, providing insights and guidelines that help scholars make informed decisions in their model application and development. You can find the paper here: 

## Repository Overview

This repository offers practical scipts for using and fine-tuning open-source LLMs as discussed in our paper. It includes scripts for running LLMs in a zero-shot configuration and detailed instructions for fine-tuning models on your datasets.

## Supported Models

In this repository, we provide scripts and guidance for the following models:

### Zero-shot / Few-Shot Configuration:

- GPT-3.5 
- GPT-4
- Huggingchat (LLaMA-1)
- LLaMA-1
- LLaMA-2
- FLAN-T5

### Fine-tuning Support:

- LLaMA-1
- LLaMA-2
- FLAN-T (XL)
- GPT-3.5

## Installation

To utilize the scripts and guides provided in this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenSource-LLM-Practitioner-Guide.git
```


## Example Dataset and Tutorial

To help you get started and to facilitate the adaptation of our scripts to your specific needs, we've included an example within the repository that demonstrates the use of LLMs with a small dataset. This example serves as a practical tutorial, guiding you through the process of applying the models in a real-world scenario.

### What's Included:

- **Example Dataset:** A small, curated dataset that is ready to be used with the provided scripts.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorial:** Detailed instructions that walk you through the process of running the models on the example dataset, illustrating the workflow from data input to result analysis.

### How to Use the Example:

1. Navigate to the cloned repository.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the tutorial scripts to run the scripts on the example dataset.
3. Observe the outputs and familiarize yourself with the workflow and adjustments you might need to make for your datasets.

This example is designed to provide a hands-on experience, making it easier for you to understand how to adapt and apply the provided scripts and methodologies to your own text annotation tasks.
